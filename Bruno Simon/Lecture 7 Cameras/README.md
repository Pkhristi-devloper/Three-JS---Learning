# Lecture 7: Cameras in Three.js

This lecture covers the concept of cameras in Three.js.

## Overview

- **Camera** is an abstract class in Three.js.
- You should not use the `Camera` class directly.
- Instead, use its subclasses such as:
    - `PerspectiveCamera`
    - `OrthographicCamera`

## Key Points

- Cameras define the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.
- Different camera types are suited for different use cases.
- Learn how to set up and position cameras to control what is visible in your 3D scene.
