Now we are using the js file or simply script tag to load three js.
but loading three js with a <script> tag has too many limitations
it doesn't include some of the classes which are necessary.

we need to run a server to emulate a website and for security reasons

we will use bundler to load three js.

bundler is a tool in which you send Javascript, CSS, HTML,images, Typesript, Stylus,Saas,etc.
the bundler apply potential modifications and output a web friendly "bundle"
Can do one more like local server, manage dependencies, improve compability, add modules support, optimize files, deploy, etc.

we will use node.js or npm to install the three js inside our server.
